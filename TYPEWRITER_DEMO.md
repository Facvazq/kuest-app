# Typewriter Animation Implementation

## âœ¨ What Was Added

A beautiful typewriter animation has been added to the homepage title! Here's what happens when users visit your site:

### ðŸŽ­ Animation Sequence

1. **Initial Delay** (0.8s): The page loads with the hero section visible
2. **First Line** (0.8-2.5s): "Fac Systems" types out letter by letter with:
   - Gradient text effect (white â†’ green â†’ white)
   - Blinking cursor
   - 120ms per character
3. **Second Line** (2.7-5.0s): "Development Portfolio" types out
4. **Description** (4.2s): Subtitle fades in
5. **Button** (4.8s): "Explore Projects" button appears

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Effects
